### Flask Application Design
For the given requirement of creating a website with two text boxes using Flask and Bootstrap, here's the design of the application:

**HTML Files**
- **index.html**: This is the main page that displays the two text boxes.
- **styles.css**: Includes styles for the application, providing formatting and layout to the page.

**Routes**
- **index**: The main route that renders the index.html page.

**Bootstrap**
Bootstrap will be used as the front-end framework for styling and layout purposes. It will be integrated into the application using the Flask-Bootstrap extension, providing easy access to Bootstrap components and styling.

**Implementation**
1. Set up a Flask application and configure Flask-Bootstrap.
2. Create the index.html file and include the necessary HTML elements for two text boxes and a submit button.
3. Link the index.html file to the index route in Flask.
4. Add styles to the styles.css file to customize the appearance of the text boxes and other elements.

This Flask application design follows a minimal approach to meet the requirement of creating a simple website with two text boxes, utilizing Bootstrap for styling and layout.
